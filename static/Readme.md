**Source:** Census block data from U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 Census, Summary File 1, aggregated by PSU Population Research Center to approximate City of Portland Neighborhood Association boundaries.  Boundaries were provided by the City of Portland in Summer, 2011.  Some neighborhood association boundaries overlap; data in this table is included in both neighborhoods (e.g. Alameda/Irvington overlap area is included in both Alameda and in Irvington).

**Note:**  Fields with 8 character field names are directly from Census Bureau tables.  Fields with 10 character field names were combined by PRC from more detailed fields in Census Bureau tables.*
